# Introduction

This tutorial explains the process of unzipping `.kmz` files, importing `.kml` files using the `readOGR()` function from the [`rgdal`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgdal/index.html) package to add Chicago Transportation Authority (CTA) ‘L’ train lines and bus routes to a map of the City of Chicago.


## Necessary Packages

To follow the tutorial, you'll need to install the following [packages installed](https://www.statmethods.net/interface/packages.html):

* [`sp`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/index.html): classes and methods for spatial data.

* [`rgdal`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgdal/index.html): Primarily used to create spatial data frames, using the [Geospatial Data Abstraction Library](http://www.gdal.org/).

```{r Install Packages, eval = FALSE}
install.packages( c( "sp",  "rgdal" ) )
```


# CTA Open Data

The [City of Chicago Open Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/) contains a list of publically available datasets from the [Chicago Transportation Authority (CTA)](http://www.transitchicago.com/data/).

We’ll import the five following datasets:

* **CSV** file of [CTA System Information - List of ‘L’ Stops](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-System-Information-List-of-L-Stops/8pix-ypme): This list of ‘L’ stops provides location and basic service availability information for each place on the CTA system where a train stops, along with formal station names and stop descriptions.

* **KML** file of [CTA ‘L’ (Rail) Lines](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-L-Rail-Lines-kml/sgbp-qafc): Lines representing approximately where the CTA rail lines are.

* **KML** file of [CTA ‘L’ (Rail) Stations](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-L-Rail-Stations-kml/4qtv-9w43): Point data representing approximate location of Station head house. (Not necessarily where an entrance to station would be.)

* **KML** file of [CTA Bus Stops](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Bus-Stops-kml/84eu-buny): Point data representing over 11,000 CTA bus stops. The Stop ID is used to get Bus Tracker information.

* **KML** file of [CTA Bus Routes](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Bus-Routes-kml/rytz-fq6y): Line data representing CTA Bus Routes. Source data are NAVTEQ street centerlines.

# Import CSV into R

To import a CSV file into R, from the City of Chicago Open Data Portal, you’ll do the following:

1. Click the `Download` Button on the top-right of the webpage.

2. Hover your mouse on `CSV`, right-click, and click on the `Copy Link Address` button.

<img src='https://github.com/cenuno/cenuno.github.io/raw/master/Mapping_CTA_files/figure-html/Import_CSV_into_R.png' style='margin:0px auto; display:block; width: 100%' class='center'<image/>

3. Store the link as a character vector to be used in `file` argument inside the `read.csv()` function, while setting `header` equal to TRUE and `stringsAsFactors` equal to FALSE.

```{r Import CTA L Info, eval = FALSE}
# List of L stops
ctaLinfo <- read.csv( file = "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/8pix-ypme/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
                      , header = TRUE
                      , stringsAsFactors = FALSE
                      )
```

# Welcome to KMZ

KMZ files are [zipped KML (Keyhole Markup Language)](https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmzarchives?csw=1) files with a .kmz extension. The contents of a KMZ file are a single root KML document, which is commonly expressed as “doc.kml”. The line and point data regarding CTA ‘L’ trains and buses is stored as a KMZ, requiring us to unzip the file prior to using the KML file inside.

## Import KMZ into R
To import a KMZ file into R, from the City of Chicago Open Data Portal, you’ll do the following:

1. Hover your mouse on `Download`, right-click, and click on the `Copy the Link Address` button.

<img src='https://github.com/cenuno/cenuno.github.io/raw/master/Mapping_CTA_files/figure-html/Import_KML_Into_R.png' style='margin:0px auto; display:block; width: 100%' class='center'<image/>
*Image couresy of City of Chicago*

2. Paste the link into the `url` argument inside the `download.file()` function. Be sure to name the zip file with the `destfile` argument. You’ll reuse that exact same character string when unzipping the file. However, you’ll always be extracting the `“doc.kml”` file that resides inside the unzipped KMZ file.

## Working Directory Matters

I'll be downloading the zip file into my current working directory. If you'd like to place it elsewhere, please use the `setwd()` function to declare your preferred working directory to store the downloaded files.

```{r Download KMZ Files, eval = FALSE}
# optional
# setwd( dir = "/your/preferred/wd/filepath")
library( sp )
library( rgdal )

# Plotting Functions

Plotting the CTA requires the use of four functions, in order of appearance:

* [`pdf`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/grDevices/versions/3.4.3/topics/pdf): pdf starts the graphics device driver for producing PDF graphics.

* [`par`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/versions/3.4.3/topics/par): used to minimize the white space on the plot, as well as declaring a dark background color.

* [`plot`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/versions/3.4.3/topics/plot): used to display the [spatial polygons data frame](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/sp/versions/1.2-5/topics/SpatialPolygonsDataFrame-class). This script “hides” the borders of the City of Chicago Community Areas by filling the polygons with the same color as the borders.

* [`lines`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/graphics/html/lines.html): used to display the [spatial lines data frame](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/sp/versions/1.2-6/topics/SpatialLines-class) of the CTA ‘L’ rail lines.

* [`points`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/graphics/html/points.html): used to display the [spatial points data frame](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/sp/versions/1.2-6/topics/SpatialPoints-class) of the CTA ‘L’ rail line stations.

* [`dev.off`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/grDevices/versions/3.4.3/topics/dev): shuts down the specified (by default the current) device.
