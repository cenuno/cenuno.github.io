# Welcome

My name is Cristian E. Nuno and I believe that sharing knowledge is one way to make the world a better place.

[*Urban Data Science*](https://cenuno.github.io/) showcases my latest efforts to combine my public policy background and my data scientist background into open-source tutorials. The idea is that people can and should combine these two fields to make the world a better place by sharing knowledge.

By lifting the black box and exposing both the excitment and limitations of data analysis, I wish to inpsire folks with less technical backgrounds to jump into the field of data analytics. The world needs you - so start learning today!
