# Welcome

My name is Cristian E. Nuno and I believe that sharing knowledge is one way to make the world a better place.

*Urban Data Science* showcases my latest efforts to combine my public policy and data analytics background into open-source tutorials.

By lifting the black box and exposing both the excitment and limitations of data analysis, I wish to inpsire folks with less technical backgrounds to jump into the field of data analytics. The world needs you - so start learning today!
