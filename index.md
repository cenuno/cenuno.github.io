## Cristian E. Nuno

My name is Cristian E. Nuno. One year ago I never knew about GitHub. I thought R was a sound pirates made; I thought Python was a type of snake. Looking back, I never knew how all three would advance my passion for urban policy.

## My Journey

I want to be an urban data scientist. I understand that this title is a [neologism](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/neologism); however, I firmly believe the future will require all social scientists, policy makers, and business people to harness the power of technology to showcase their research, policy recommendations, and business decisions.

I studied urban planning and economics at the [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://www.honors.uic.edu/) (UIC). Thile economics taught me how certain things influence people to take one action over another, it was urban planning that engrained in me the value of looking at things at the individual level.

It is one thing to say the city is doing well; it is an entirely different thing to say the same for one particular block in one particular neighborhood.

The emphasis on the individual was eloquently expressed through the writings of [Mike Royko](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/730719.html) and [Studs Terkel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyl1BvHo9LM). I learned of great Chicago leaders such as [Jane Addams](http://www.hullhousemuseum.org/), [Harold Washington](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/84/harold), and [Florence Scala](http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/410114.html).

Yet all these people led me to one inescapable conclusion: my hometown needs to do a better job of ensuring its residents a chance to succeed.

### Urban Policy Meets Data Science

At Syracuse University, I took a class in the fall of 2016 with Professor Jesse Lecy entitled [*Data Driven Management*](http://www.lecy.info/data-driven-management). His class exposed me to the power of open-source software. The programming language R and the code hosting platform GitHub enable users from around the world to build, update, and revise tools in real time. 

No longer would policy decisions be hidden in an appendix behind some-odd page report; now, anyone with a computer could extract the exact code used to reach those same conclusions. 

With the help of Professor Lecy, I finished my time at Syracuse with both a Masters of Public Administration and Certificate in Advanced Study in Data Science. The two fields will help me quantify, visualize, and simplify urban policy decisions to aid in the slow march of equal opportunity in my hometown.
