## Cristian E. Nuno

My name is Cristian E. Nuno. One year ago I never knew about GitHub. I thought R was a sound pirates made; I thought Python was a type of snake. Looking back, I never knew how all three would advance my passion for urban policy.

## My Journey

I want to be an urban data scientist. I understand that this title is a [neologism](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/neologism); however, I firmly believe the future will require all social scientists, policy makers, and business people to harness the power of technology to showcase their research, policy recommendations, and business decisions.

I studied urban planning and economics at the [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://www.honors.uic.edu/) (UIC). TWhile economics taught me how certain things influence people to take one action over another, it was urban planning that engrained in me the value of looking at things at the individual level.

It is one thing to say the city is doing well; it is an entirely different thing to say the same for one particular block in one particular neighborhood.

It was here that I soaked up Chicago's history through the writings of [Mike Royko](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/730719.html) and [Studs Terkel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyl1BvHo9LM). I learned of great Chicago leaders such as [Jane Addams](http://www.hullhousemuseum.org/), [Harold Washington](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/84/harold), and [Florence Scala](http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/410114.html).

Yet all these people led me to one inescapable conclusion: my hometown needs to do a better job of ensuring its residents a chance to succeed.
